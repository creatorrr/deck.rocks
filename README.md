#### [deck.rocks](https://deck.rocks): Let GPT3 make your pitch deck for you!

this is a fun side project for generating pitch decks using GPT-3, (the awesome AI model from OpenAI). here's how it works:

1. describe your smashingâ„¢ idea in 1-2 sentences
2. get a deck tailor-made for you
3. that's it! ðŸ˜‰

You can also browse the [gallery](https://deck.rocks/gallery).

## Examples

- "construction company that uses robots to build houses without any labor, reducing the cost to build a home and making home ownership affordable to all. The mission is to end homelessness throughout the world.."
- "Wine dinner series from regions lesser known."
- "blockchain pay to earn games easy."

## How it works

- The raw input is cleaned up and passed through a series of natural language models to generate data for different parts of the deck.

- Perhaps the most important of these is GPT-3, an open-ended text-generation model by OpenAI.

- Most of the answers are generated by GPT-3 given prompts like:
  Generate a catchy tagline for: [your idea].

- We use Dall-E (mini) for generating logos from the idea description.

- We use the ProductHunt API to find similar existing products to compare with.

- We first guess the corresponding product category for the idea and then find the most semantically similar products by comparing their embeddings with the idea.
